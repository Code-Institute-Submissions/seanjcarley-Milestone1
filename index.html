                    After numerous requests from family and friends to provide unique cakes for <a href="#">kids birthday parties</a> and <a href="#">weddings</a>, Jo saw an opportunity to provide themed cakes that were unique, and more personal than
                    the offerings on the supermarket shelf. 
                    <br/>
                    With each new cake, the interest grew, and in 2012 Jo's Bakery and Novelty Cakes was born. In the early days Jo was working on her own, and as a result, production was limited 2-3 cakes per month.
                    This was to allow for meticulous attention to detail on the decoration and, ensure the highest quality of the cake itself. After all, these masterpieces taste as good as they look. Fast-forward 7 years, Jo's Bakery and Novelty Cakes is
                    operating out of a purpose-built premises and a state-of-the-art kitchen, and a team of 7 bakers. All of this means that there is more chance of your cake being created.
                    <br/>
                    Jo's Bakery and Novelty Cakes ensures that all precautions are taken in relation to food safety. Further information can be obtained from the <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/" target="_blank">Food Safety Authority of Ireland</a> website.
